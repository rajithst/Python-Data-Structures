 * Linked Lists
     - Singly Linked List
        * Append 
        * Prepend
        * Insert after a given node
        * Delete node by Value
        * Delete node by position
        * Get length of a linked list
        * Swap two nodes
        * Reverse Linked list iteratively 
        * Reverse Linked list recursively 
        * Remove duplicates
        * Count the Occurrences Iteratively
        * Count the Occurrences Recursively
     - Circular Lined List
        * Append 
        * Prepend
        * Delete
     - Double Linked List

 * Stack
 * Queue

 * Trees
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
   
 * Graph
    - Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Find the shortest path from a start node to end node  
    - Detect Cycles in a directed graph
    - Find Path exist between given two nodes
    - Count number of edges of an Undirected Graph
    - Check Undirected Graph is a Tree
    - Delete edge from the Graph
